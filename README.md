# A-Simple-Dictionary-based-Compression-and-Decompression

## Dictionary-Based Compression and Decompression Tool

This MIPS assembly language project implements a dictionary-based compression and decompression tool using the MARS simulator. The tool assigns unique 16-bit binary codes to words in text files, enabling lossless compression and decompression. It dynamically manages a dictionary stored in `dictionary.txt`, expanding as new words are encountered. The tool is case-sensitive and handles special characters. It provides compression ratios and supports both manual and automatic modes.

### Key Features
- Compression and decompression of text files.
- Dynamic dictionary management.
- Case-sensitive processing.
- Compression ratio calculations.
- Manual and automatic modes.

### Usage
1. Load the program into the MARS simulator.
2. Assemble and run the program.
3. Follow the on-screen menu prompts.
